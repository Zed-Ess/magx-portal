Security Considerations

User Authentication

Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for VPN access
Use strong password policies for all users with VPN access


Access Control

Restrict VPN access to only necessary users (teachers and admins)
Implement role-based access control to limit what resources can be accessed via VPN


Encryption

Use strong encryption (AES-256) for VPN connections
Regularly rotate encryption keys


Monitoring and Logging

Implement comprehensive logging of VPN connections
Set up alerts for unusual connection patterns or potential security incidents


Client Security

Provide clear guidelines for users on securing their devices
Consider implementing client-side security checks before allowing VPN connections



This integration creates a complete OpenVPN solution that:

Authenticates against your existing user database
Provides secure remote access to authorized staff
Implements multi-factor authentication
Keeps detailed logs of VPN activity
Offers an easy-to-use management interface for administrators
