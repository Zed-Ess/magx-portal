Build RESTful APIs for a school management system! This sounds like a great project. 
Outline an approach for creating this backend server that will work with a React.js frontend interface in a local network environment.

Let's start by defining the key components and requirements:

## Core Requirements

1. RESTful API endpoints for school management data
2. Local server that doesn't require internet access
3. Support for multiple users connecting via server IP
4. Integration with React.js frontend
5. Iintegrate OpenVPN into this project to enable secure remote access.


## API Structure

Here's my proposed structure for the school management API:

### 1. Authentication System
- Login/logout endpoints
- User session management
- Role-based access control (admin, teacher, student, etc.)

### 2. Student Management
- CRUD operations for student records
- Student attendance tracking
- Academic performance records

### 3. Teacher Management
- CRUD operations for teacher records
- Teaching assignments
- Schedule management

### 4. Course Management
- CRUD operations for courses
- Curriculum planning
- Class scheduling

### 5. Grades and Assessment
- Grade recording
- Assignment tracking
- Report generation
